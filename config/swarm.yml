# Agent Swarm Configuration
# Multi-agent orchestration settings for animation generation

swarm:
  # Operating mode: sequential | parallel | collaborative | competitive
  # - sequential: Agents run one after another, each building on previous output
  # - parallel: Independent agents run simultaneously, results merged
  # - collaborative: Agents negotiate and refine together over multiple iterations
  # - competitive: Multiple agents propose solutions, best one wins
  mode: collaborative

  # Active agents in the swarm
  agents:
    - prerequisite-explorer   # Identifies foundational concepts and prerequisites
    - math-enricher          # Enhances mathematical content and formulas
    - visual-designer        # Designs visual layout and element arrangement
    - narrative-composer     # Creates narrative flow and explanation structure
    - code-generator         # Generates final Manim Python code

  # Optional agents (enable as needed)
  # - quality-reviewer       # Reviews code quality and suggests improvements
  # - style-harmonizer       # Ensures consistent visual style throughout

  # Voting threshold for collaborative decisions (0.0 - 1.0)
  # Higher values require more agent agreement
